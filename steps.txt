1. Make sure you have an AWS account setup
2. Create users, groups, and roles in IAM limited to the responsibilities of each (roles show up when creating EC2 instances)
3. Download the access key (credentials.csv) file
4. Add the credentials to your environment as below, or just keep the file safe and refer to it where needed:
	# setup AWS key
	export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKI...NMQ"
	export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="kMjD...X8HDC"
5. Generate a key pair in EC2, download the .pem file and store it in ~/.ssh/
6. Create an EC2 instance referencing the key pair and apprpriate IAM role
7. Get the public DNS of the instance and add the following to ~/.ssh/config (the ubuntu user is just for ubuntu):

	Host ds-ec2-1
        	HostName ec2-54-245-21-212.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
        	User ubuntu
        	ForwardAgent yes
        	TCPKeepAlive yes
        	IdentityFile /Users/zgreyn/.ssh/zgreyn-ds-or.pem


    NOTE: For Amazon Linux, the user name is ec2-user. For RHEL5, the user name is either root or ec2-user. For Ubuntu, the user name is ubuntu. For Fedora, the user name is either fedora or ec2-user. For SUSE Linux, the user name is either root or ec2-user. Otherwise, if ec2-user and root don't work, check with your AMI provider.

8. SSH in (ssh ds-ec2-1)
9. Install whatever you want on there (for example, copy this file and run it: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/galvanize-zgreyn/setup.sh)
